# Main

This directory contains the GraphQL schema used to generate the client's services for working with the CIViC server's API. The schema uses the [GraphQL Code Generator spec and tools](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to develop, test, and mock, the API. The CIViC client's API services are also generated from the schema.
