            Today we have rolled out support for a new core concept in CIViC: 
            <a href="https://civic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model/molecular_profiles.html" target="_blank"> Molecular Profiles</a>.
            Molecular Profiles are logical combinations of one or more CIViC Variants.
            While most Molecular Profiles will consist of a single Variant (“Simple”) they will also allow users to 
            build “Complex” (multi-variant) Molecular Profiles to associate Evidence with. 
            These complex profiles expand the CIViC data model to allow for clinical significance to be evaluated within contexts such 
            as variant co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity. 
            Going forward, Evidence will be associated with a Molecular Profile rather than directly with a Variant. 
            If you have any questions about this change, please feel free to 
            <a href="mailto:help@civicdb.org">contact us</a>. We have also
            prepared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--i54jY746w" target="_blank" >video</a > explaining this new feature.

          CIViC is a community-edited forum for discussion and interpretation of
          peer-reviewed publications pertaining to the clinical relevance of
          variants (or biomarker alterations) in cancer. These interpretations
          may include associations between molecular alterations (or lack of
          alteration) and one or more therapies, diagnoses, prognoses or other
          treatment decisions. These interpretations of clinical significance
          (or lack of clinical significance) are purely for research purposes. A
          finding of no interpretation does not necessarily indicate lack of
          relevance for any specific variant or biomarker alteration.
          Interpretations are not presented in ranked order of potential or
          predicted importance. These interpretations make no promise or
          guarantee of any clinical benefit (or lack of clinical benefit).
