          CIViC is a community-edited forum for discussion and interpretation of
          peer-reviewed publications pertaining to the clinical relevance of
          variants (or biomarker alterations) in cancer. These interpretations
          may include associations between molecular alterations (or lack of
          alteration) and one or more therapies, diagnoses, prognoses or other
          treatment decisions. These interpretations of clinical significance
          (or lack of clinical significance) are purely for research purposes. A
          finding of no interpretation does not necessarily indicate lack of
          relevance for any specific variant or biomarker alteration.
          Interpretations are not presented in ranked order of potential or
          predicted importance. These interpretations make no promise or
          guarantee of any clinical benefit (or lack of clinical benefit).
