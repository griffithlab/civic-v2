        <h2>CIViC MCP Server</h2>
        <p nz-typography>
          The Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)
          knowledgebase provides a community-driven, open-source platform for
          discussing the biological and Clinical Significance of molecular
          variants in cancer. To enable users to make complex connections
          between CIViC information, we developed the CIViC Model Context
          Protocol (MCP) server, which allows large language models (LLMs) to
          directly interface with the CIViC API through natural language,
          facilitating the rapid summarization of expertly curated cancer
          variant interpretations.

        <h2>CIViC-Fact</h2>
        <p nz-typography>
          Accurate interpretation of genomic variants is critical for precision
          oncology but remains slow and dependent on specialized expertise.
          Public knowledgebases such as the Clinical Interpretation of Variants
          in Cancer (CIViC) help by curating literature-backed variant
          interpretations in a structured form, yet verification and review have
          become major bottlenecks. To address this, we developed CIViC-Fact, a
          benchmark dataset and pipeline for testing automated systems that
          verify the accuracy of cancer variant claims. CIViC-Fact links
          structured claims to sentence-level supporting or refuting evidence
          from full-text articles, and includes expert annotations and
          explanations.

        <h2>CIViCmine</h2>
        <p nz-typography>
          To aid curation and provide the greatest coverage for precision
          oncology databases, particularly CIViC, we propose the use of text
          mining approaches to extract these clinically relevant biomarkers from
          all available published literature. To this end, a group of cancer
          genomics experts annotated sentences that discussed biomarkers with
          their clinical associations and achieved good inter-annotator
          agreement. We then used a supervised learning approach to construct
          the CIViCmine knowledgebase. We extracted 121,589 relevant sentences
          from PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central Open Access full-text papers.
          CIViCmine contains over 87,412 biomarkers associated with 8035 genes,
          337 drugs, and 572 cancer types, representing 25,818 abstracts and
          39,795 full-text publications. Through integration with CIVIC, we
          provide a prioritized list of curatable clinically relevant cancer
          biomarkers as well as a resource that is valuable to other
          knowledgebases and precision cancer analysts in general. All data is
          publicly available and distributed with a Creative Commons Zero

        <h2>CIViC Natural Language Inference (CIViC NLI)</h2>
        <p nz-typography>
          The CIViC natural language interpretation (NLI) project will create a
          fact-checking companion data set for CIViC. The aim of this project is
          to annotate relevant sections of the full-text of articles that are
          used to support evidence items in the Clinical Interpretation of
          Variants in Cancer database (CIViC). This will create a novel
          high-quality oncology-focused data set for natural language inference
          (NLI). he particular sentences/spans in the text which should be
          selected are those that are sufficient and required to ensure the
          article does indeed contain/support the CIViC entry.
