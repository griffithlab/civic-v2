        nzDescription="TSV and VCF releases of CIViC data are provided at regular intervals for the convenience of those who require the use of a static file. For most users, we recomend utilizing our API which. Using the API will provide you with the richest metadata about CIViC entries as well as the most current versions of all evidence statements. In fact, the entire CIViC web frontend runs off the exact same API that is available for public use.">

            The CIViC server produces nightly and monthly releases that include a subset of all primary entity records (Genes, Variants, Evidence, Variant Groups, and Assertions). Both TSV and VCF versions are provided below - just locate the specific entity type and data format you wish to obtain, then click on the relevant button to download.
          </p>
          <p nz-typography>
            These records do not contain user profile data, discussion and commentary, data provenance and revision history, or information dynamically obtained from resources external to CIViC (e.g. MyVariant.Info, MyGene.Info). Variant TSV releases only include variant records with accepted evidence records. Variant TSV releases from before August 2020 include all variant records, irregardless of the status of the associated evidence items. Evidence TSV releases only include accepted evidence items and exclude pending or rejected evidence items. Assertion TSV releases only include accepted assertions. Accepted VCF releases include only variants with accepted evidence items and/or accepted assertions. Accepted & Submitted VCF releases include Variants with accepted and/or submitted evidence items and/or assertions.
          </p>
          <p nz-typography>
            In order to comply with the VCF specification, the VCFs can only include variants with complete coordinates. By contrast, the TSV variants file may contain variants with coordinates that have not been fully curated in CIViC. Additional variants are of types that can not be properly represented in VCF format. Thus, the number of variants will be lower in the VCFs compared to the number of variants in the TSV.
          </p>
